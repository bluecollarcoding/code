# Learning to Code

Getting started programming with some essential skills.

## Terminal (command-line) basics

The command-line is where the programmer spends most of their time.
Knowledge of a handful of common terminal commands is important.
Flags (e.g., `--help`) are options and give flexibility to the commands.
All commands have great getting started tutorials / common uses with flags.
Even experienced programmers are constantly Googling simple things.
Only the most commonly used options are (eventually) memorized via muscle memory.


- `ls`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `mkdir`
- `cp`
- `echo`
- `cat`
- `rm`

Google stuff like: "using cp basics ubuntu".

## Git & GitHub

`git` is a command-line tool, GitHub is the online interface.

Go through [this hello world guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

The following is a pretty standard workflow for working on code, get to know it very well:

- `git clone $yourRepo`
- `cd $yourRepo`
- `git log`
- `ls`
- `git status`
- make a new branch
- _edit a file_
- `git status`
- `git add -u`
- `git status`
- `git commit -m "some commit"`
- push your branch to GitHub
- make a Pull Request

## Editor

There's so many options. I learned `vim` and am stuck in my ways. You'll probably want to try [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#installing-atom-on-linux)
seems like it's what all the cool kids are using these days. (Unrelated to ATOMs, btw).

## Hello World

Every programming language has a "Hello World" tutorial. Google them & try a few different languages:

- `python`
- `JavaScript`
- `bash` -> not a programming language but **very** useful; executes stuff on the command-line for you

Make some customized Hello World apps, commit them to your repo, push a new branch, make a PR and we'll go from there.
